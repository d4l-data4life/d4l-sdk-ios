== About the {compname} API

This section gives you an overview of the {compname} API.
The SDK handles all communication with the backend servers.
This abstracts away much of the know-how needed to communicate with the servers and exposes a number of lean custom models.
Integration partners and developers can rely on these models and the exposed methods to interact with the {compname} {phdp-plat}.

Only logged-in users can run queries and perform actions.
When a request is made without a valid access token and a refresh token, the SDK throws an `unauthorized` exception.

=== Authentication and authorization

This section covers the authorization project features of the SDK.

- *Authentication* is the process of verifying who users are.
- *Authorization* is the process of verifying what users have access to.

The SDK automatically handles all authentication and user management tasks. The user login is managed by the {compname} auth app to ensure the safety of the userâ€™s credentials. When the `login` functionality is invoked, the SDK opens a web view with the necessary pages. Or redirects in the case of a web-based app.

==== Displaying the login screen

To display the login screen to users.

[source,swift]
----
Data4LifeClient.default.presentLogin(on: self, animated: true) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        // Handle result
    case .failure(let error):
        // Handle error
    }
}
----

==== Displaying the login screen with custom OAuth 2.0 scopes

Scopes are a mechanism in the OAuth 2.0 protocol to limit an application's access to a user account.
The scope information is displayed to the user in the login screen.

To display the login screen with additional scopes to users, use the `presentLogin` method.

[source, swift]
----
let scopes = ["example", "scope"]
Data4LifeClient.default.presentLogin(on: self, animated: true, scopes: scopes) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        // Handle result
    case .failure(let error):
        // Handle error
    }
}
----

==== Using additional parameters for the login

To display the login screen with additional parameters, for example, with the `loginCompletion` callback, use the following example:

[source,swift]
----
func presentLogin(on viewController: UIViewController, animated: Bool, scopes: [String]? = nil, presentationCompletion: (() -> Void)? = nil, loginCompletion: @escaping DefaultResultBlock)
----

==== Logging out users

To log the currently logged-in user out of the current session, use the `logout` method.

[source,swift]
----
func logout(completion: @escaping DefaultResultBlock)
----


==== Checking if a user is logged in

To check if a user is logged in, use the `userLoggedIn` method:

[source,swift]
----
func userLoggedIn(_ completion: @escaping DefaultResultBlock)
----

==== Receiving updates about the session state

To receive updates about the session state, use the `sessionStateDidChange` method.

[source,swift]
----
func sessionStateDidChange(completion: @escaping (Bool) -> Void)
----

=== Using debug logging

The SDK supports logging to console for debug configurations.
It is disabled by default. To enable it, set the `isLoggingEnabled` flag on the client to `true`.
However, release configuration is always silent.

[source, swift]
----
Data4LifeClient.default.isLoggingEnabled = true
----

=== Handling response threads

All SDK calls accept `DispatchQueue` as a parameter.
The defined queue is used to return results, the `main` queue is the default.

[source, swift]
----
let queue = DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background)
Data4LifeClient.default.creteRecord(document, queue: queue) { result in
    // Handle result
}
----

=== Managing records

The following sections describe how you perform queries and other actions for documents and records.

===== Use of annotations

The `create`, `update`, `search` and `count` methods can optionally use `annotations` as a parameter. This parameter allows to tag records with custom information saved as a list of strings. Annotations can be filtered inside the `search` and `count` methods.

==== Creating a new record

To create a new record, use the `createFhirStu3Record` method.

[source,swift]
----
func createFhirStu3Record<R: FhirStu3Resource>(_ resource: R,
    annotations: [String]? = nil,
    completion: @escaping ResultBlock<Record<R>>)
----

==== Creating new FHIR records

To create several new records, use the `createFhirStu3Records` method. The annotations will be added to all the created records.

[source,swift]
----
func createFhirStu3Records<R: FhirStu3Resource>(_ resources: [R], annotations: [String] = [], completion: @escaping ResultBlock<BatchResult<Record<R>, R>>)
----

==== Fetching a FHIR record by its ID

To fetch records for the given ID, use the `fetchFhirStu3Record` method with the `identifier` parameter of the record.

[source,swift]
----
func fetchFhirStu3Record<R: FhirStu3Resource>(withId identifier: String, of type: R.Type = R.self, completion: @escaping ResultBlock<Record<R>>)
----

==== Fetching multiple FHIR records with IDs

To fetch one or more records for the given IDs, use the `fetchFhirStu3Records` method with the `identifiers` parameters of the records.

[source,swift]
----
func fetchFhirStu3Records<R: FhirStu3Resource>(withIds identifiers: [String], of type: R.Type = R.self, completion: @escaping ResultBlock<BatchResult<Record<R>, String>>)
----

==== Updating a FHIRrecord

To update a record, use the `updateFhirStu3Record` method.
If annotations are set to nil, existing annotations won't change, otherwise they will override existing ones. If you only need to append new annotations, pass them as a parameter including the old ones in order to maintain them.

[source,swift]
----
public func updateFhirStu3Record<R: FhirStu3Resource>(_ resource: R,
    annotations: [String]? = nil,
    queue: DispatchQueue = responseQueue, completion: @escaping
    ResultBlock<Record<R>>)
----

==== Updating several FHIR records

To update several records, use the `updateFhirStu3Records` method. If annotations are set to nil, existing annotations won't change, otherwise they will override existing ones for all updated records.

[source,swift]
----
func updateFhirStu3Records<R: FhirStu3Resource>(_ resources: [R], annotations: [String]? = nil, completion: @escaping ResultBlock<BatchResult<Record<R>, R>>)
----

==== Deleting a FHIR record by its ID

To delete a record with its given ID, use the `deleteFhirStu3Record` method with the `identifier` parameter of the record.

[source,swift]
----
func deleteFhirStu3Record(withId identifier: String, completion: @escaping ResultBlock<Void>)
----

==== Deleting multiple FHIR records by their IDs

To delete multiple records with their given IDs, use the `deleteFhirStu3Records` method with the `identifiers` parameters of the records.

[source,swift]
----
func deleteFhirStu3Records(withIds identifiers: [String], completion: @escaping ResultBlock<BatchResult<String, String>>)
----

==== Counting FHIR records

To count the stored records per record type, use the `countFHIRRecords` method with the given `type` parameter.
If you don't provide a record type, the client returns the count of all available records.

[source,swift]
----
func countFhirStu3Records<R: FhirStu3Resource>(of type: R.Type?,
    annotations: [String] = [],
    completion: @escaping ResultBlock<Int>)
----

==== Creating a new AppData record

To create a new AppData record, use the `createAppDataRecord` method or the `createCodableAppDataRecord` method. The annotations parameter allows to tag records with custom information saved as a list of strings. Annotations can be filtered inside the `search` and `count` methods.

[source,swift]
----
func createAppDataRecord(_ data: Data,
                         annotations: [String] = []],
                         queue: DispatchQueue = responseQueue,
                         completion: @escaping ResultBlock<AppDataRecord>)

func createCodableAppDataRecord<D: Codable>(_ codable: D,
                                            annotations: [String] = [],
                                            queue: DispatchQueue = responseQueue,
                                            completion: @escaping ResultBlock<AppDataRecord>)
----

If the codable version of the create is used, the `AppDataRecord` has a convenient function to get the resource back:

[source,swift]
----
extension AppDataRecord {
    func getDecodableResource<D: Decodable>(of type: D.Type = D.self) throws -> D
}
----

==== Fetching an AppData record by its ID

To fetch AppData records for the given ID, use the `fetchAppDataRecord` method with the `identifier` parameter of the record.

[source,swift]
----
func fetchAppDataRecord(withId identifier: String,
                        queue: DispatchQueue = responseQueue,
                        completion: @escaping ResultBlock<AppDataRecord>)
----

==== Updating an AppData record

To update an AppData record, use the `updateAppDataRecord` method or the `updateCodableAppDataRecord` method.
If annotations are set to nil, existing annotations won't change, otherwise they will override existing ones. If you only need to append new annotations, pass them as a parameter including the old ones in order to maintain them.

[source,swift]
----
func updateAppDataRecord(_ data: Data,
                         recordId: String,
                         annotations: [String]? = nil,
                         queue: DispatchQueue = responseQueue,
                         completion: @escaping ResultBlock<AppDataRecord>)

func updateCodableAppDataRecord<D: Codable>(_ codable: D,
                                            recordId: String,
                                            annotations: [String]? = nil,
                                            queue: DispatchQueue = responseQueue,
                                            completion: @escaping ResultBlock<AppDataRecord>)

----

==== Deleting an AppData record by its ID

To delete an AppData record with its given ID, use the `deleteAppDataRecord` method with the `identifier` parameter of the record.

[source,swift]
----
public func deleteAppDataRecord(withId identifier: String,
                                queue: DispatchQueue = responseQueue,
                                completion: @escaping ResultBlock<Void>)
----

==== Counting AppData records

To count the stored AppData records, use the `countAppDataRecords` method.

[source,swift]
----
func countAppDataRecords(annotations: [String] = [],
                         queue: DispatchQueue = responseQueue,
                         completion: @escaping ResultBlock<Int>)
----

=== Managing resources with attachments

In FHIR, some resources can index a document, clinical note, and other binary objects to make them available to a healthcare system. At the moment attachment which can contain attachment are:
- `DocumentReference`
- `DiagnosticReport`
- `Medication`
- `Practitioner`
- `Patient`
- `Observation` (including its component attachments)
- `Questionnaire` (including its nested items attachments)
- `QuestionnaireResponse` (including its nested items and answers attachments)

==== Downloading all resource's attachments with their data payloads

If you want a record to be downloaded with its given ID and its attachments, use the `downloadStu3Record` method and the `identifier` parameter of the record.

[source,swift]
----
func downloadStu3Record<R: FhirStu3Resource>(withId identifier: String, completion: @escaping ResultBlock<Record<R>>)
----

==== Downloading multiple resource records and all their attachments with their data payloads

If you want one or more records to be downloaded with their given IDs and their attachments, use the `downloadStu3Records` method and the `identifiers` parameters of the records.

[source,swift]
----
func downloadStu3Records<R: FhirStu3Resource>(withIds identifiers: [String], of type: R.Type = R.self, completion: @escaping ResultBlock<BatchResult<Record<R>, String>>)
----

=== Handling attachments

==== Downloading attachment data

If a `FhirStu3Resource` with attachments is fetched using the `fetchFhirStu3Record` method, all of the attachments only have metadata (for example, `title` and `contentType`) but no data payload. To download an attachment including the data payload, use the `downloadStu3Attachment` method or the `downloadStu3Attachments` method.

[source,swift]
----
Data4LifeClient.default.downloadStu3Record(withId: "identifier", of: DocumentReference.self) { result in
    guard let document = result.value?.resource else {
        return
    }

    guard let attachments = document.getAttachments() else {
        return
    }

    let data = attachments.first?.getData()
}

----

==== Using different size versions

When you implement downloading attachments, and if different options are available, you can specify which version of the attachment to download.
When downloading a medium-size or small-size image, the downloaded attachment ID is a composed identifier of the original attachment and the thumbnail ID, separated by the `#` character.
When the `downloadType` parameter is not specified or is unavailable, the original-size attachment (full-size version) is downloaded.
The SDK automatically generates the medium-size and the small-size versions of attachments during attachment creation for resizable attachments. The following file formats support resizable attachments: PNG, TIFF, and JPEG.

[source,swift]
----
public enum DownloadType {
    case full, medium, small
}
----

==== Cancelling the request in progress

The downloading attachments methods `downloadStu3Attachment` and `downloadStu3Attachments` return an object to cancel the request in progress:

----
let cancellableRequest = Data4LifeClient.default.downloadStu3Attachments(withIds: identifiers, recordId: documentId) { [weak self] result in
    ...
}

cancellableRequest?.cancel()
----

==== Observing the download progress

To get a https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/progress[Progress] object, which you can use, for example, for a progress bar, include the `onProgressUpdated` closure.

----
 let cancellableRequest = Data4LifeClient.default.downloadStu3Attachments(withIds: identifiers, recordId: documentId,
 onProgressUpdated: { progress in
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        self.progressView.setProgress(Float(progress.fractionCompleted),
        animated: true)
    }
 }, completion: { [weak self] result in
    ...
 })
----


==== Downloading a single attachment with data payload

If you want an attachment to be downloaded including the data payload, use the `downloadStu3Attachment` method with the parameter of the attachment ID.

[source,swift]
----
func downloadStu3Attachment(withId identifier: String,
    recordId: String,
    downloadType: DownloadType = .full,
    onProgressUpdated: ((Progress) -> Void)? = nil,
    completion: @escaping ResultBlock<Attachment>)
-> Cancellable
----

==== Downloading a list of attachments with data payloads

If you want one or more attachments to be downloaded including their data payloads with their given IDs, use the `downloadStu3Attachments` method with the parameters of the attachment ID.

[source,swift]
----
func downloadStu3Attachments(withIds identifiers: [String],
    recordId: String,
    downloadType: DownloadType = .full,
    onProgressUpdated: ((Progress) -> Void)? = nil,
    completion: @escaping ResultBlock<[Attachment]>)
-> Cancellable
----

=== Storing custom identifiers

Most of the FHIR resources support adding custom identifiers per client.
The following resources are supported:

- `DocumentReference`
- `Observation`
- `DiagnosticReport`
- `CarePlan`
- `Organization`
- `Practitioner`
- `Patient`
- `Questionnaire`

You can use these helper functions on all supported resources.

[source,swift]
----
func addAdditionalId(_ id: String)
func setAdditionalIds(_ ids: [String])
func getAdditionalIds() -> [String]?
----

To add and fetch a custom identifier, use the following.

[source,swift]
----
let document = DocumentReference(...)
document.addAdditionalId("some-custom-identifier")

guard let ids = document.getAdditionalIds() else { return }
let storedIdentifier = ids.first
----

To overwrite custom identifiers with new values, use the following.

[source,swift]
----
let document = DocumentReference(...)
let identifiers = ["some-custom-identifier-one", "some-custom-identifier-two"]
document.setAdditionalIds(identifiers)
----

To delete all of the custom identifiers, use the following.

[source,swift]
----
let document = DocumentReference(...)
document.setAdditionalIds([])
----
